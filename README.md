# Text Classification Competition: Twitter Sarcasm Detection 
# About the Project
The goal of this competition/project is to classify a given sequence of tweets (responses) as sarcastic or non-sarcastic. The tweets with its corresponding immediate context 
and full context is provided as continous responses to each tweets.The tweets are provided with conversation context which is an ordered list of dialogue. The objective of this competition is to predict the ‚Äúlabel‚Äù of the response (tweets) using the given context (either immediate or full context) 


# Understanding Data:

Each line contains a JSON object with the following fields : 
- ***response*** :  the Tweet to be classified
- ***context*** : the conversation context of the ***response***
	- Note, the context is an ordered list of dialogue, i.e., if the context contains three elements, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, in that order, then `c2` is a reply to `c1` and `c3` is a reply to `c2`. Further, the Tweet to be classified is a reply to `c3`.
- ***label*** : `SARCASM` or `NOT_SARCASM` 

- ***id***:  String identifier for sample. This id will be required when making submissions. (ONLY in test data)

For instance, for the following training example : 

`"label": "SARCASM", "response": "@USER @USER @USER I don't get this .. obviously you do care or you would've moved right along .. instead you decided to care and troll her ..", "context": ["A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics . Pamela Karlan , you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering , and using a child to do it .", "@USER If your child isn't named Barron ... #BeBest Melania couldn't care less . Fact . üíØ"]`

The response tweet, "@USER @USER @USER I don't get this..." is a reply to its immediate context "@USER If your child isn't..." which is a reply to "A minor child deserves privacy...". Your goal is to predict the label of the "response" while optionally using the context (i.e, the immediate or the full context).
